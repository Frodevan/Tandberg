This is an interface for use with the TDC3000 tape drive,
for use between the computer and formatter. It contains:

    * An MC6800 CPU on a 921.6KHz crystal oscillator
    * 2 KB ROM of type 2708
    * 1.25 KB RAM of type 2112A-4
    * An MC6850 UART on a MC14411 clock source

    The CPU uses an inverting data-bus transceiver, so all
    data written/read is inverted. As such, the ROM dump
    presented here is as the binary appears directly from the
    IC themselves, and will as such not render any readable
    dissasembled 6800-code without the mentioned inversion.


Memory map:

    $0000 - $0018   TDC-3000 Formatter board
    $0100 - $0101   UART
    $0200 - $06FF   RAM
    $7C00 - $83FF   ROM
    $FC00 - $FFFF   ROM mirror of $8000 - $83FF

    Note, there may be more mirroring, but these are the
    addresses that are used by the firmware.


When looking from behind, towards the back of the drive cabinet:

    * The left DB-25M connector is RS-232
    * Five switches likely set handshake and data-format
    * The right DB-25F connector seems to be current-loop

It is likely that the firmware in ROM implements some sort of
command-set the computer can use to access the tape drive.
